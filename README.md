# Website design 
Hello :wave: Folks

I created this portfolio website using HTML and CSS flexbox properties.
<br>It took me more than a week to align things in a suitable place.<br>Removing white lines and CSS flexbox, positions took much time. In the end, I figured it outâ€¦ Big thanks to the Stackoverflow team.
